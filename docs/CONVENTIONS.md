# Project Conventions

- The language used in the project is English. So variables, classes, functions, file names, folder names and anything else must be in English

- The following style guides where follwed:

  - [Typescript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/styleguide/typography)
  - [CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) to write code
  - [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) to choose names for styles.

- Every component must be inside a folder. This component must contain at least three files (in most cases): the component rendering file, the translation file and the styles file. The folder name must be in Kebab Case while the component name must be in Pascal Case. Example: UserWindow component

  - /user-window
    - UserWindow.tsx
    - UserWindow.translations.tsx
    - UserWindow.module.css

- Follow the [Best Practices](BEST_PRACTICES.md)
