# General Client Next

![alt text][main-technologies]

## Description

> This a general architecture for enterprise projects using Next.js on the client side. This project follows DDD principles and adopts the Clean Architecture

> Although it uses Next.js, most of the code can be extracted in a way that it can work with other libraries and frameworks with minor modifications. This can be done because the business rules is decoupled from the user interface layer (Next.js).
